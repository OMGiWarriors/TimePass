## OUR VISSION

Our **vision** is to empower our friends giving them all-in-one services so that they can not only do time-pass effectively;
but also they will get addicted to it. No one in the world will defeat our friends in doing timepass, is our Vision's statement.

### Project Introduction

People always criticize the ones who do time-pass; even I did criticize others; coz I didn't get time for doing timepass.
But trust me there is nothing anything like which is called time-pass. Its all about making our mood and serving our interests.
When that interest is far far short term, we doing something which the person serving long term gets giffy about. For example, when we play games, most of the time, people who dont give/have little time for themselves call it a timepass. But, WHAT IF, they meet someone who are far more busy and imp person than him, like a CEO?? CEO will say, what the heck man? all these guys are doing timepass by doing job whatever they are at, smaller or bigger, if you get what I'm trying to say. IMHO, there is nothing like a timepass, if there is something in life, its the Karma and the results of it. If the guy doing job or playing game gets money or some refreshment or a healthy exercize to brain then our TimePass is here to support them.

## One-Liner

Well! The time is already passing by, we just wanna make it a good time-pass.
