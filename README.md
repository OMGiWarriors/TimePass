### Project Introduction

Well! People always criticize the ones who do time-pass, even i did critisize others, coz i didn't get time for timepass.
But trust me there is nothing like time-pass. Its all about making our mood and serving our interests.
When that interest is far far short term we play game and most of the time people call it a timepass.

Well! The time is already passing by, we just wanna make it a good time-pass.
